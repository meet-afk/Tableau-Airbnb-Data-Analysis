1.  **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled blank cells, and corrected data type inconsistencies.
2.  **Data Transformation:** Standardized text entries (e.g., 'F' to 'Female') and created new columns for analysis (e.g., Age Brackets).
3.  **Aggregation:** Used Pivot Tables as the engine to summarize vast amounts of data into meaningful metrics.
4.  **Visualization:** Built Pivot Charts from the aggregated data and assembled them into a cohesive dashboard layout.
5.  **Interactivity:** Connected all charts and tables with Slicers to enable drill-down analysis.

## <a name="key-insights"></a> üìä Key Insights

### 1. Income & Gender vs. Purchase Decision
-   **Finding:** Customers with higher average incomes are more likely to purchase a bike.
-   **Insight:** Males who purchase bikes represent the segment with the highest average income, indicating strong purchasing power.

### 2. Commute Distance as a Purchase Driver
-   **Finding:** The overwhelming majority of purchases are from customers with a commute of **0-1 miles**.
-   **Insight:** This suggests bikes are primarily used for short-distance travel or recreation, not long commutes. This is a key insight for marketing messaging.

### 3. The Core Demographic: Age
-   **Finding:** The **middle-aged group (31-54)** dominates bike sales.
-   **Insight:** Marketing and product development should be heavily focused on this age bracket, as adolescents and seniors show significantly lower purchase rates.
