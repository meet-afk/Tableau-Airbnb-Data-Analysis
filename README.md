## <a name="-about-the-project"></a> üìù About The Project

This project uses a real-world Airbnb listings dataset to build a powerful and interactive dashboard in **Tableau**. The goal is to analyze and visualize key metrics that are useful for multiple stakeholders:
-   **For Guests:** Identify popular neighborhoods, compare pricing by room type, and check for seasonal availability.
-   **For Hosts:** Understand the market landscape, benchmark pricing, and identify opportunities for their listings.

## <a name="-dashboard-features"></a> ‚ú® Dashboard Features

-   ‚úÖ **Geospatial Map:** An interactive map highlighting the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of listings.
-   ‚úÖ **Price Distribution Analysis:** Visuals showing the correlation between price, room type, and neighborhood.
-   ‚úÖ **Listing Availability:** A calendar or heat map view to analyze availability trends and identify peak seasons.
-   ‚úÖ **Host Activity Metrics:** Charts that provide insights into host performance and listing frequency.
-   ‚úÖ **Dynamic Filters:** Users can filter the entire dashboard by neighborhood, price range, and room type for a customized analysis.

## <a name="-tech-stack"></a> üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Tableau:** The core tool used for data visualization and building the interactive dashboard.
-   **Microsoft Excel:** Used for initial data inspection and preliminary cleaning before importing into Tableau.

## <a name="-project-workflow"></a> ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1.  **Data Sourcing:** The Airbnb listings dataset was imported into Tableau Desktop.
2.  **Data Preparation:** In Tableau's data source pane, the data was cleaned, data types were corrected, and necessary joins or relationships were established.
3.  **Worksheet Creation:** Individual visualizations (maps, bar charts, trend lines) were created in separate worksheets to analyze specific metrics.
4.  **Dashboard Assembly:** The worksheets were combined into a single, cohesive dashboard.
5.  **Adding Interactivity:** Filters and "Use as Filter" actions were implemented to allow all visuals to update dynamically based on user selections.

## <a name="-key-insights-from-the-analysis"></a> üìä Key Insights from the Analysis

-   **Top Neighborhoods Identified:** The dashboard clearly shows which neighborhoods are hotspots for Airbnb activity, guiding both investment and travel decisions.
-   **Price Correlates with Room Type:** A strong, consistent pattern was found where "Entire home/apt" listings command a significantly higher price than "Private room" or "Shared room" listings across all top locations.
-   **Host Activity Patterns:** Analysis revealed trends in how actively hosts manage their listings, which can be an indicator of listing quality and responsiveness.

-   **Enrich Data:** Integrate external datasets like local events, holidays, or public transport proximity to add more context to pricing and availability.
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Use Tableau's analytics functions or integrate with R/Python to build a simple model for price prediction.
